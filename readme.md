## Credit

All info about the rings, including the images, come from the [Dark Souls 3 fandom wiki](https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Souls_III), with some minor changes. I did not use FextraLife since some info on that wiki is not accurate.

The info was copied over to a json file which runs locally, since most Dark Souls API's are incomplete or no longer function.
